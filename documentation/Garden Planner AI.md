# **Garden Planner AI - Project Master Document**

## **1. Project Definition**

**Description:** Garden design and planning tool that integrates a visual canvas (drag-and-drop) with artificial intelligence for technical validation and agronomic recommendations. 
**Main Objective:** Enable any user, without advanced knowledge, to design a viable, aesthetic, and sustainable garden.

## **2. Technical Specifications (MVP)**

### **2.1. The Canvas**

* **Terrain Definition:** Dimension input (length/width) or drawing irregular shapes.  
* **Design Layers:** Separation by levels (Soil, Plants, Infrastructure like paths/fountains).  
* **Interaction:** Drag-and-drop system with automatic object scaling.

### **2.2. Plant Database**

* Cards with: Scientific name, light requirements (full sun, shade), soil pH, watering needs, maximum size, and hardiness zone.

## **3. Advanced Features (Differentiators)**

### **3.1. Google Maps API Integration**

* **Topographic Import:** Locate the actual terrain to obtain exact dimensions and cardinal orientation (important for shadows).  
* **Zoning:** Automatic detection of local climate based on location.

### **3.2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

* **Viability Validator:** Analyze if chosen plants can coexist (allelopathy) and if space/light is sufficient.  
* **Proactive Recommender:** Suggest "companion" plants that improve garden health or solve drainage/soil problems.

### **3.3. Temporal Planning and Export**

* **Dynamic Calendars:** Generate a file (.ics or PDF) with sowing, pruning, and harvesting dates.  
* **Maintenance Guides:** Personalized watering and fertilization instructions by season.

## **4. Ideas for Future Versions**

* **Growth Simulation:** Visualize the garden in 1, 5, and 10 years.  
* **Dynamic Shadow Analysis:** Simulate sun movement according to the time of year.  
* **Budget:** List of materials and plants with estimated prices.
